1. 1-minute introduction

Hello everyone. Nice to meet you. I have created a course to introduce you to a blockchain platform that is noteworthy in Klaytn. 
Existing blockchain platforms have limitations in terms of speed, performance, and completeness. 
Kakao's Klaytn blockchain has successfully improved performance and completeness by keeping block creation times within one second and by handling more than 3000 transactions per second. 
Transaction costs are also very cheap. 
You can build a service chain to achieve scalability and privacy.

Entry barriers have also been drastically lowered so that legacy DApp developers can immediately use the Klaytn blockchain. 
Klaytn is now easier to use because it supports the solidity as smart contract language, 
and supports the Truffle framework, which is a DApp development framework. 
Even those who are new to the course can make it easy to follow them while watching the lecture.





I will point out the problems of existing blockchain platforms 
and see how Klaytn has solved them and created a better alternative. 
(Click) Next, I'll show you how to use the Klaytn tools such as wallet, IDE, scope. 
Finally, let's take time to understand the benefits of Klaytn by creating a simple addition game through caver.js.

Use Klaytn which is to lead the blockchain platform 
and create a blockchain application (BApp) that will become popular in the future.
